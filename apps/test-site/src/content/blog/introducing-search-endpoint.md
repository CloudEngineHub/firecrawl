We’re shipping **/search** today – the endpoint that allows you to search and scrape all with one API call. Whether you’re building agents, doing research, finding leads, or working on SEO optimization, you need to find and get the right web data. Now you can get it with one API call.

## Reinventing Page Discovery

Everyone’s been asking for this – an endpoint that combines search with scraping. Makes sense when you think about it. Agents and developers constantly need to discover pages, then extract their content.

## How It Works

Using /search in code is straightforward. Here’s a quick example:

```python
from firecrawl import FirecrawlApp, ScrapeOptions

app = FirecrawlApp(api_key="fc-YOUR_API_KEY")

# Search and scrape in one call
results = app.search(
    "latest AI agent frameworks",
    limit=5,
    scrape_options=ScrapeOptions(formats=["markdown", "links"])
)

# Get search results with full content
for result in results.data:
    print(f"Title: {result['title']}")
    print(f"Content: {result['markdown'][:200]}...")
```

Everything’s customizable – language, location, time range, output formats, and beyond. Want results from last week in German? Simply add tbs="qdr:w" and lang="de".
