Firecrawl just raised a $14.5M Series A led by Nexus Venture Partners.

We’re putting the web’s knowledge on tap for AI, with more than 350,000 developers already signed up, our open source project crossing 48k stars on GitHub, and companies like Zapier, Shopify, and Replit using us to power their apps.

We’ve grown 15x in the past year and this is just the beginning.

## How we got here

It’s been 16 months since we started Firecrawl.

The journey actually began with Mendable, our AI chat solution for documentation, which teams at Snapchat, MongoDB, and DoorDash adopted quickly. But we kept hitting the same wall, finding that getting clean, structured web data for AI was unnecessarily hard.

Every AI app was rebuilding the same infrastructure, including scraping websites, extracting structured data, handling JavaScript, dealing with rate limits, and parsing messy HTML, with thousands of developers solving the same problem differently.

We realized the real opportunity was upstream, to build the infrastructure once, make it perfect, and give AI universal access to the world’s information through a simple API.

That bet paid off brilliantly. Zapier recently integrated Firecrawl in a single afternoon, and their chatbots now ingest customer websites automatically, answering FAQs and capturing leads within minutes. Replit uses us for documentation ingestion, while top hedge funds rely on us for market analysis.

The variety tells the story, from lead enrichment tools and competitive intelligence systems to price monitoring and research agents, they all need the same thing, reliable web data at scale.

## Why we exist

The web holds nearly everything humans know, serving as the most complete, real-time record of our knowledge.

But this knowledge is trapped, scattered across millions of domains, locked behind JavaScript, and constantly changing. AI needs this data to be useful, to answer questions accurately, to take actions confidently, and to understand the world as it exists right now.

Firecrawl exists to make web data programmable through our full toolkit that covers web search and extraction, giving developers exactly what they need, in the exact format they want.

We’re building the missing layer between AI and the web.

## Where we’re going

You can expect our team to spend even more time in three areas.

**1. Infrastructure**
Our proprietary Fire-Engine technology already delivers 33% faster speeds and 40% higher success rates than existing solutions, and now we’re scaling it worldwide for sub-second response times for everyone, everywhere.
We’re investing in reliability, uptime, and performance because as we exponentially grow, your data extraction needs to work every single time.

**2. Product**
We just shipped v2 with 10x faster scraping through intelligent caching, semantic crawling where you describe what you want in plain English, a new summary format that extracts insights instantly, and search that supports news and images on demand.
In the coming months, expect features that fundamentally change how AI and builders interact with the web, including smarter extraction, batch data gathering, and change monitoring.

**3. Sustainable partnerships**
We’re building a future where publishers get paid when AI uses their content, because the web needs a sustainable model for high-quality content. When paywalled content powers AI, creators should benefit directly.
This isn’t just about technology, it’s about building the right incentives. Publishers create valuable content, AI needs that content, and we’re building the marketplace that connects them fairly.

## Who is investing

We’re thrilled to welcome new investors.

- Nexus Venture Partners, which has backed companies like Postman, Hasura, and Druva, with special thanks to Abhishek for believing in our vision.
