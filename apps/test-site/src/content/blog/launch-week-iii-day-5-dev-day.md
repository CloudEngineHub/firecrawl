**Day 5 of Launch Week III is here â€” and itâ€™s all about developers.** Weâ€™re rolling out a stack of improvements aimed at making Firecrawl smoother, faster, and better to build with.

## New and Improved Python SDK

Weâ€™ve completely overhauled the Python SDK to make development faster, clearer, and more efficient. Hereâ€™s whatâ€™s new:

- Named parameters and return types for improved readability and type safety
- Full support for async functions to eliminate blocking and improve performance

This update is all about enabling you to build faster and smarter with less friction.

## Rust SDK: Packed With Upgrades

The Rust SDK got a serious set of improvements too:

- Support for batch scraping jobs
- Crawl job cancellation
- Improved error handling
- Built-in support for generating `llms.txt`
- Search functionality for smarter indexing

If youâ€™re building in Rust, these changes open up a lot more flexibility.

## New: Firecrawl Dark Theme for Code Editors

We launched our Firecrawl Light Theme on Day 0. Today, weâ€™re releasing the Dark Theme â€” for those who prefer building in low light.

Itâ€™s available now for:

- VSCode
- Windsurf
- Cursor

Download it directly from the [VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Firecrawl.firecrawl-theme) and bring Firecrawlâ€™s look and feel to your editor.

## Quality of Life Updates

Weâ€™ve also shipped a number of smaller improvements behind the scenes to streamline developer experience across the board. Includinng now every Firecrawl plan now includes support for up to 20 seats â€” no more user limits. Bring your team and build together.

Thatâ€™s all for Day 5! Stay tuned for Day 6 ðŸš€
