Today we’re launching **Templates** – making it super easy to discover, share, and reuse Firecrawl examples. Our community has built so many amazing things with Firecrawl, and we’re excited to templatize and share them to help you get started faster.

## Why Templates?

We’ve seen everything from simple data extraction scripts to sophisticated lead generation systems and AI research tools built by our users and team. But getting started with the right configuration for specific use cases can be challenging.

Templates fix this by giving you a library of ready-to-use playground setups, code snippets, and complete repositories you can implement with just a few clicks. No more figuring out the perfect parameters – just grab a template and go!
Three Types of Templates

### 1. Playground Templates

Pre-configured Firecrawl Playground setups you can load instantly. We have several ready to go, including templates for crawling entire websites and scraping JavaScript-heavy pages. Access these directly from the Playground under the Templates dropdown.

### 2. Code Snippets

Reusable code segments you can drop into your own applications. Examples include Hubspot CRM Lead Enrichment and a cool O4 Mini Web Crawler.

### 3. Complete Repositories

Full applications built with Firecrawl that you can run instantly with our Replit integration. Check out Open Deep Research and Trend Finder repositories with the one-click “Run with Replit” button.

## From the Community, For the Community

Our template library lives at [firecrawl.dev/templates](https://www.firecrawl.dev/templates), where you can browse, search, and filter to find exactly what you need.

Anyone can create and share templates:

- **Save for yourself** - Keep private templates for your own projects
- **Share with everyone** - Public templates get their own page
- **Upvote the best ones** - Help surface the most valuable solutions

For now, we’re running a quick review process for public templates to ensure quality, but this may change as the platform evolves.
