**Welcome to Launch Week III, Day 6 — Firecrawl MCP Upgrades.**

Today, we’re rolling out a major set of updates to our Firecrawl MCP server — our implementation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that powers scraping workflows with LLMs and web data.

## FIRE-1 Web Action Agent Support

The Firecrawl MCP server now supports our new **FIRE-1** model. This means you can now:

- Use FIRE-1 via the MCP scrape and extract endpoints.
- Seamlessly collect data behind interaction barriers — logins, buttons, modals, and more.
- Incorporate intelligent, agent-driven scraping into any MCP-compatible tool.

## Server-Sent Events (SSE)

We’ve added **HTTP Server-Side Events (SSE)** support to the MCP, making real-time communication and data flow smoother.

- SSE is now available for local use.
- This means you can plug into a running Firecrawl MCP server with minimal overhead.
