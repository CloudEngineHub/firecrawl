	<p>
		This website serves as a comprehensive test environment for <a href="https://firecrawl.dev">Firecrawl</a>, the open-source web scraping and
		crawling API. The site is intentionally designed to be simple, static, and deterministic to
		ensure reliable and consistent test results across different configurations and environments.
		This website uses <a href="https://astro.build">Astro</a> to generate static content designed for our testing environment.
	</p>

	<h2>Purpose</h2>
	<p>
		The primary purpose of this test site is to provide a stable target for automated testing of
		web scraping functionality. This test site maintains consistent content to enable repeatable test scenarios.
